### Notes
Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
I ran into an error with the @IBOutlets for the posterView and the app was not running. After looking up the error I found out that I had created two @IBOutlets for the posterView and one of them was just floating and wasn't connected to anything.  Once I fixed that, the app was back and running.

### Notes
My collection view layout would not change despite trying everything, the movie posters only showed up as tiny grids on the entire layout. When I change the estimate size for the collection view, the posters filled up to a regular size.
